# üå¶Ô∏è Precipitation Prediction using Simple LSTM

This project aims to predict daily precipitation using historical weather data. It employs a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## üìä Dataset

* The data used is from the `data.csv` file, which contains daily weather observations such as temperature (average, max, min), wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation amounts.
* Data from the year 2016 is used for **training** and **validation** (split 80% for train, 20% for validation).
* Data from the year 2017 is used for **testing** the model's performance.

**Data Sample (`data.csv`):**

## üè∑Ô∏è Features Used

The following features were selected and preprocessed to be used as input for the LSTM model:

* `month_sin`, `month_cos`: Cyclical encoding of the month.
* `Data.Temperature.Avg Temp`: Average temperature (Scaled).
* `Data.Temperature.Max Temp`: Maximum temperature (Scaled).
* `Data.Temperature.Min Temp`: Minimum temperature (Scaled).
* `Data.Wind.Speed`: Wind speed (Scaled).
* `wind_dir_sin`, `wind_dir_cos`: Cyclical encoding of wind direction.

*(Note: Cyclical features like month and wind direction sin/cos are generally not scaled as they are already within a limited range [-1, 1].)*

**Target Variable:**

* `Data.Precipitation`: Precipitation amount (Scaled for training, inverse-scaled for evaluation).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology / Workflow

1.  **Import Libraries:** Load necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
2.  **Load Data:** Read data from the `data.csv` file.
3.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Select relevant columns.
    * Split data into Train/Validation (2016) and Test (2017) sets.
    * Perform cyclical encoding for `Date.Month` and `Data.Wind.Direction` (converting direction to numeric first).
    * Scale numerical features (temperature, wind speed) and the target variable (`Data.Precipitation`) using `StandardScaler` (fit only on training data).
4.  **Data Generation:** Create time series sequences using `keras.preprocessing.timeseries_dataset_from_array` with a sequence length of 14 days (`n_steps`).
5.  **Define Model:** Build simple LSTM models with varying numbers of units (16, 32, 64, 128).
6.  **Compile Model:** Compile models using the Adam optimizer, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, and track Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
7.  **Train Model:** Train each model using the training data and validate with the validation data, employing `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting based on validation loss.
8.  **Test Model and Evaluate:**
    * Make predictions on the test set.
    * Inverse transform the predictions back to the original scale.
    * Calculate performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R¬≤).
9.  **Plot Results:** Plot Training & Validation Loss curves and graphs comparing true vs. predicted values.

## üß† Model Architecture

A simple LSTM architecture was used, consisting of:

1.  **Input Layer:** Expects sequences of shape `(14, 8)` (14 time steps, 8 features: month\_sin, month\_cos, avg\_temp, max\_temp, min\_temp, wind\_speed, wind\_dir\_sin, wind\_dir\_cos).
2.  **LSTM Layer:** An LSTM layer with a varying number of units (16, 32, 64, or 128).
3.  **Dense Layer:** A single output unit for predicting the precipitation value.

## üìà Results

The performance of the LSTM models with different numbers of units was evaluated on the test set (data from 2017). Key metrics calculated are summarized below:

| Model (LSTM Units) | MSE      | MAE      | R¬≤       |
|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| 16                 | 0.4550   | 0.4870   | -0.0919  |
| 32                 | 0.5016   | 0.5275   | -0.2038  |
| 64                 | 0.5090   | 0.5337   | -0.2217  |
| 128                | 0.5210   | 0.5454   | -0.2504  |

*Note: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indicate the average error magnitude. The negative R-squared (R¬≤) values suggest that these models, with the current configuration and features on the 2017 test set, perform worse than a baseline model simply predicting the mean precipitation of the test set. This might indicate the need for further feature engineering, model tuning, or considering different model architectures.*

The performance of the LSTM models with different numbers of units was evaluated on the test set (data from 2017). Key metrics (MSE, MAE, R¬≤) were calculated for each model configuration (refer to the notebook or script output for detailed results).
